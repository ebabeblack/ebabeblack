## Hi there 👋

- I’m currently working on sharpening up my geospatial analysis  and data vizualiztion skills! For work I'm jumping around between different RA/TA positions while I'm at Harvard's GSD.
- I’m coming from a background working in the art world (ask me about my job paiting church ceilings) but with a stayed passion for urbanism, creativity, ethical thinking and collarboration.
