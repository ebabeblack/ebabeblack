## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- In pursuit of a MSC in Urban Planning at Harvard University Graduate School of Design (concentration in Urban Analytics)
- Iâ€™m currently working on sharpening up my geospatial analysis  and data vizualiztion skills! For work I'm jumping around between different RA/TA positions while I'm in school.
- Iâ€™m coming from a background working in the art world (ask me about my job paiting church ceilings) but with a stayed passion for urbanism, creativity, ethical thinking and collarboration.
